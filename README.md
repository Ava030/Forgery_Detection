**Image Forgery Detection with VGG16 and SVM**

This repository presents a novel approach to Image Forgery Detection using a combination of pre-trained VGG16 model and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The system is trained to detect two distinct types of forgeries - copy-move forgery and spliced forgery.

The copy-move forgery detection algorithm identifies regions within an image that have been copied and pasted elsewhere in the same image. The splice forgery detection algorithm identifies regions that have been cut from one image and pasted into another.


**Prerequisites:**

The project uses Python and requires the following packages:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Keras
scikit-learn
PIL


**Running the Classifier:**

 To use the classifier, run the classifier.py Python script.
